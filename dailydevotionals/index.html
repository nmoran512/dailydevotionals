    <h1>Steadfast in Righteousness</h1>
    <h2>Proverbs 11:19-21(NASB)</h2>
  </div>
  <h4 class="verse">Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live, but he who pursues evil will die.
  <br> Those of crooked hearts are an abomination to the Lord, but those of blameless ways are His delight
  <br>Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered.</h4>
    <p class="devotionals">Walking in the ways of the Lord is right (Psalms 33:4, Mark 10:18, Psalms 145:17-19). It's also life bringing
    (Deuteronomy 8:1, Matthew 6:33). It's also hard (Galatians 5:16-17).
    <br>We must be steadfast in our walk in order to live. The Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines steadfast as
    <em>"to be firmly fixed in place, not subject to change, firm in belief, determination, or adherence."</em> That is the kind of determination we need in order to live.
    We are not asked to be perfect, but we need to pursue righteousness. And in our pursuance, remain steadfast.
    <br>It is only by The Holy Spirit abiding in us, guiding us, strengthening us, and enabling us (Philippians 2:13) that we can pursue righteousness.
    <br><br>Sinful ways brings death, sin is death, and the wages of our sin is death (Romans 6:23). Death was brought into the world because of the first sin.
    <br>Let us strive for righteousness, and strive to be blameless. We cannot do this on our own strength, but we must rely on Christ  our Savior,
    <br>and set ourselves to live according to the Spirit and not our flesh (Romans 8:5-17).</p>

      <h4>Prayer: </h4>
      <p class="prayer">Thank you father for Your word. Thank you for Your love for us, and that are mindful of each and every one of us.
        <br>I ask that You would write the Word on the tablet of my heart, and let it bring forth life. I thank You for
        <br>the privilege to receive the Holy Spirit, and to have You abide in me, and for me to abide in You.
        <br> I ask that You would give me the grace and strength to pursue Your Kingdom and Your righteousness.
        <br>I ask all of this in Your precious and holy Name.
        <br><br>~Amen
